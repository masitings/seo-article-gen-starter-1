# App Flow Document for SEO Article Generator Starter

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new visitor arrives at the root URL of the application, they see a simple landing page that introduces the SEO Article Generator. This page prominently offers options to sign up or sign in. A visitor choosing to create an account clicks the “Sign Up” button and is taken to a registration form where they provide their email address, create a password, and confirm acceptance of terms. After submitting the form, the system sends a confirmation email with a link to verify the address. Once the email is confirmed, the user can return to the app and sign in. If a returning user clicks “Sign In,” they enter their registered email and password. If they forget their password, they click “Forgot Password,” which opens a page prompting them to enter their email. The system emails a password reset link, and when the user follows that link, they are directed to a page where they choose a new password. They submit the new password, and upon success they are redirected to the sign-in page. At any time when logged in, the user can sign out by clicking the “Logout” button located in the app’s navigation bar, which ends their session and returns them to the landing page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After signing in, the user lands on the main dashboard. At the top is a header that displays the application title on the left and a user menu on the right. Under the header, a sidebar runs along the left side of the screen listing navigation links labeled Generate Article, My Articles, Settings, and Logout. The central area of the page shows a welcome banner with the user’s name and two primary sections: the article generation form and a preview of recent articles. The article generation form occupies the upper portion of the content area and includes input fields for Article Title and Keywords, selection controls for Article Type, Size, Tone of Voice, Point of View, and Readability, and toggle switches for optional sections such as Introduction, Conclusion, and FAQ. A large “Generate Article” button sits below the form. Beneath the form is a scrolling list of the user’s most recent articles, each showing the title, date created, and a link to view details. The sidebar links allow the user to navigate away from the dashboard at any time to view all articles or adjust settings.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When the user fills out the form and clicks “Generate Article,” the client-side code validates the inputs and then displays a loading spinner. A POST request is sent to the backend endpoint `/api/generate`. This API route verifies the request body, constructs a prompt with the prompt-builder utility, and calls the external language model. If the call is successful, the generated content and associated settings are saved to the PostgreSQL database through Drizzle ORM. The API responds with the new article’s identifier and content. On the client side, the spinner is removed and the user is automatically redirected to the Article Details page. On that page, the article’s title appears at the top, followed by metadata listing the creation date and each generation setting. The full article content is displayed below, and two buttons appear at the bottom: “Regenerate” to produce a new version using the same settings, and “Back to Articles” to return to the list view.

When the user clicks the “My Articles” link in the sidebar, they land on a paginated list showing all their saved articles. Each entry shows the article title, creation date, and two actions: “View” which opens the Article Details page, and “Delete” which prompts confirmation before removing the article from the database. Clicking “View” follows the same flow described above. If the user clicks “Regenerate” on the Detail page, the form used previously is prefilled in a modal, allowing them to tweak settings or submit immediately for a new version. After regeneration completes, the new article appears alongside the older versions in the list.

## Settings and Account Management
When the user clicks the “Settings” link, they are taken to a page divided into two tabs: Profile and Subscription. In the Profile tab, fields display the user’s email and name, with an option to update their password. Changing the email or name and clicking “Save” validates the entries and updates the database, then shows a success notification. If the user updates their password, they must enter the current password, choose a new one, and confirm it before saving. The Subscription tab shows the user’s current credit balance and plan name. If the application is configured for paid tiers, a “Manage Subscription” button takes the user to a billing portal where they can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel their plan. After making changes in either tab, the user can click “Back to Dashboard” to return to the main view.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user attempts to sign in with incorrect credentials, an inline error appears above the form stating that the email or password is invalid. During sign-up, if the email is already in use, the form highlights the email field and instructs the user to try a different address. On the generation form, any missing required field triggers an inline error next to the field. If the API call to `/api/generate` fails—whether due to network issues, invalid input, or a downed AI service—the user sees an alert banner describing the error and a “Try Again” button that reopens the form with previously entered values intact. During article listing or detail viewing, if the database cannot be reached, the content area shows a fallback message asking the user to retry after checking their connection. In all cases of errors, the header and sidebar remain accessible so the user can navigate to other parts of the app or log out.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
A user begins by discovering the app’s landing page, signing up with an email and password, and verifying their address. After signing in, they arrive at the dashboard where they immediately see the form for generating SEO articles and a preview of recent work. They fill out the form, send it off, and are taken to a detail page showing the freshly generated article stored in their account. From there, the user explores views of their full article history, regenerates content with the same or revised settings, and deletes outdated pieces. When they need to update their personal information or manage subscription credits, they navigate to the Settings area, make their changes, and return to content creation without disruption. Through clear error messages and straightforward navigation, the user’s path from first visit to daily usage remains seamless, culminating in the effortless generation, review, and management of SEO-optimized articles.
